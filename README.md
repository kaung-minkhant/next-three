## Description

This project take a very shallow dip to the world of ThreeJS with NextJS using React Three Fiber (R3F) library. Not very impressive stuff, but the basics and some concepts. This project may be updated gradually, as I learn more about ThreeJS in the future. I may do a seperate or use this project to learn more about vanilla ThreeJS as well.
